Repository for the challenge #5 Matplotlib

In an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of various treatment regimens in fighting cancer, the pharmaceutical company Pymaceuticals Inc. conducted a detailed study using mice as test subjects. The experiment involved administering a series of drug treatments and documenting the evolution of tumor volume over time, along with collecting data on weight and number of metastatic sites. This crucial research provides valuable insights into which treatments may hold the most promise for future clinical studies and offers a deeper understanding of the relationship between test subjects weight and disease progression.

To complete this challenge we have an starter code folder with a Jupyter Notebook File(pymaceuticals_starter) to review the desired format for this assignment, in which the step by step are broken down to make a complete analysis and generate different graphs and Data Frames with the necessary information. We also have two .csv files (Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv) which will be merged to have an extensive database to complete the activity.

To complete this activity, I have used resources such as Office Hours and the assistance of ChatGPT to debug and optimize the code's functionality. Additionally, I mostly used ChatGPT with the funcionality of agg. function, flierprops and fixing errors due to duplicate data and lastly for formatting.
